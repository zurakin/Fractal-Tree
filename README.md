# Fractal Tree
 just trying to create a fractal tree on python using opencv
 
 the tree is fully customisable
 
 to change a tree parameter open the constates.py file where you can choose the screen dimensions, the thikness of the tree ...
 
 
 # Usage:
 
 
 Run fractal_tree.py
 
 The trackbar on top of the screen is used to change the angle of the first branch of the tree
 
 To change it select a value using the trackbar then hit enter on your keyboard to apply the changes ,the program will then restart
 
 To exit the program hit esc on your keyboard
