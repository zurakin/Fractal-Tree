# Fractal Tree
 just trying to create a fractal tree on python using opencv

 the tree is fully customisable

 to change a tree parameter open the constates.py file where you can choose the screen dimensions, the thikness of the tree ...


 # Usage:

 Run fractal_tree.py

 The trackbar on top of the screen is used to change the angle of the first branch of the tree

 To change it select a value using the trackbar then hit enter on your keyboard to apply the changes ,the program will then restart

 To exit the program hit esc on your keyboard

 # Notes:

 having a value of 100 in the trackbar means an angle of pi/2

 a value of of 0 means an angle of 0
